#   TowTruckChallenge

TowTruckChallenge is an interactive toy that lets you create vehicles, drive them around, and tow them. It's fun for all ages, for about two minutes.

This code includes autocompleted text from the Copilot extension, because it is incredibly intrusive and I just gave up fighting it.

#   Description

On launch, the user is prompted to either create a new vehicle or select an existing one. Created vehicles can be cars, trucks, or motorcycles. Trucks include tow functionality, and motorcycles can do wheelies.

#   Development Tools

TowTruckChallenge is developed using JavaScript and is run using the command line interface of NPM.

#   License

TowTruckChallenge isn't released under any license, and I completely abandon any legal responsibility or rights of ownership due to it's promotion of unsafe driving habits.
